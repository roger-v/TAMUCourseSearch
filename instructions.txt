When you run the program,
the first view you will see is a SearchView.
In particular, this is Main.searchView, a static member
in Main.java.

If you click the Room Availability Search Label,
It will take you to another view, a RoomAvailabilityView.
This is Main.roomAvailabilityView.

Now, every time the user presses Search while
in the Main.searchView view (the first one),
the static variable Main.currentSearch is updated.

To find out what the user just searched upon clicking the button
(which is an action executed in SearchView.executeSearch()),
there are setters and getters in CourseSearch.java to get the
Strings that the user input.

So say you want to know what subject the user searched for,
you'd use Main.currentSearch.getSubject(), which returns a String.

In the same way, if the search was a Room Availability search
where the button in the roomAvailabilityView was pressed,
then Main.currentRASearch will be updated and you can use
the getters to find out what the user searched.

Use these Strings and convert them into SQL queries
at the end of the print statements in

SearchView.executeSearch()
CSTableView.executeSearch()
RoomAvailabilityView.executeSearch()
RATableView.executeSearch()


If it was a course search, turn the results into an array
of Course objects and if it was a room availability search,
turn the results into an array of Room objects.

So in whichever executeSearch() function you fetched the data,
once it's been fetched and converted into an array of either
Course or Room, then update the respective table that is a
static member in Main.java:

For a course search, you retrieved data and turned it into Course [] results,
Update the table by using Main.csTableView.setItems(results);

For a room search, you retrieved data and turned it into Room [] results,
Update the table by using Main.raTableView.setItems(results);
