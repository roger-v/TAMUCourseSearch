# TAMUCourseSearch

This is a Java GUI put together through the use of JavaFX, JDBC (Java Database Connectivity),
and a MySQL database set up on the campus servers. The objective was to use a filer-search method
for courses that differed from the current tree-like structure that the university uses for course searching.
This project was as a part of CSCE 315 - Programming Studio, and my partners were fellow students Ifrah Tariq
and Levi Uzodike.
